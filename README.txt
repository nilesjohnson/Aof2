Visualization of A(2).

A web application using Raphael.js to organize A(2) and show it's structure by 
the coset decomposition A(2)//A(1).


TODO

 * Implement display of submodules and/or cyclic modules
 * Add Sage source code
 * Think carefully about color scheme
 * Decide on license
 * Decide on publicity of source code, and this TODO list

Done

 * "None" option for basis type still doesn't work
 * Clicking an option should update the current display immediately
 * Re-work to use 2:1 aspect ratio (fix 'squareStep')
 * Set highlighted dots to be solid red
 * Separated basis sums with more than two summands for automatic line-breaking
 * Dynamically resize info balloon to fit basis info
 * Balloons have rounded corners and no separate border.
 * Add Sqi data
 * Fixed: balloon menu showing Adem/Milnor representation could be placed differently for different dots; for example it could have the pointer at the bottom, or on the right side
 * Fixed: Milnor basis sometimes falls outside of balloon
 * improve positioning of canvas, options, and basis display
 * Hide display of "zero dots" when not highlighted
 * Tested fade effect for clear/draw menu, and decided it looks better without effect
 * Write description and instructions
 * Set dot 12-0 (Sq^6 Sq^2) to be highlighted on document load
 *
